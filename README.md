_Kwy·ji·bo, n._

	“A big, dumb, balding North American ape with no chin and a short temper.”

— [Bart Simpson](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtM6tJaPzFI)

Kwyjibo is also an experimental, automated referee for Scrabble games. It was built to explore real-time OCR, computer vision and machine learning as the subject of my dissertation at the [University of Sheffield](http://www.shef.ac.uk/) in 2011.

## About ##

You can read a little bit about how it works in this [explanation](http://brm.io/real-time-ocr/). 
Much of the image processing is done using the [Aforge.NET](http://www.aforgenet.com/) computer vision library. 
There's also a [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ywTfeTqOE) of it working.

_Note_: this project was for academic research only and is not associated with Scrabble ®
